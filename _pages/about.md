Hi! I’m a PhD student in Computer Science at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), where I’m fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Dan Alistarh](https://daslab.pages.ista.ac.at/). Before joining ISTA, I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in Iran.

My research focuses on making neural network training more efficient, particularly for large language models (LLMs). I currently work on two main areas:

- **Training in compressed formats** — developing methods for directly training sparse or quantized models to achieve end-to-end speedups.
- **Data selection** — designing algorithms to select the most “relevant” training samples to improve efficiency and performance.

I’m especially interested in algorithmic approaches to these problems and occasionally explore systems-level solutions to unlock real-world training speedups.
